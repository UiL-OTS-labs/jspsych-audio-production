        First you will see some information about the experiment and
        what type of data we will be collecting and why. You can
        then consent to participate in the experiment (or not, in
        which case the experiment will terminate immediately and no
        data will be saved).
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, you will fill out a short questionnaire. After the
        questionnaire you will get some more instructions on what to
        do.
